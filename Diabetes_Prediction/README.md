 # Diabetes prediction model
 
## Basic info
In this project we are using data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexteboul/diabetes-health-indicators-dataset/data?select=diabetes_012_health_indicators_BRFSS2015.csv) to predict the risk of diatebes.
Data was fetched from annual phone survey in 2015 in USA. There are 21 features in this data frame, which are described on Kaggle, as well as in the first part of the code in Jupyter Notebook.
We split the original data frame to 3 parts: 

Train_df : data that we will use for EDA, model finding etc

Val_df : data frame for validating different models during building process

Test_df: data that we will not look at, it's for the validation team, which will test our finished model. The purpose is to test how the model will deal with real future data that it hasn't seen

## Main parts of the project
* **Data understanding** : histograms, boxplots, correlation, observations (Done)
* **Feature engineering**  : dealing with with outliers, standardisation/normalisation, creating new features, dropping irrelevant features 
* **Modeling and evaluation** 
* **Independent testing**
